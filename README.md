# Lavner-Mad-Libs
This repository is part of Lavner's IT Academy as an activity to help the campers learn git control.

Instructors should clone this repo first so they can make a new branch. Make sure to name your branch something easy to communicate to your campers. Campers should clone the repo and use git checkout to navigate to their class branch. 

Then, the campers should make their own branch using git branch and navigate to it. Once you're there, you can edit your mad libs file.

When you finish changing the mad libs file, use git add <filename> to add your file. Then you can use git commit and git push to publish your changes.
  
Instructors, once your students are finished, have them send you their branch names. Use git merge <branch> to merge their branch into yours. You should keep a few words from each student as you merge. Then, when everyone has finished and commited their mad libs, you will have one final mad lib that has contributions from everyone!
